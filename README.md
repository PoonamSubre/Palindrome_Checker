<b>Overview:</b><br>
<br>The Palindrome Checker is a simple web-based tool designed to check whether a given number is a palindrome or not. It takes a numeric input from the user, performs the palindrome check, and displays the result on the
webpage.<br>
<br><b>How It Works:</b><br>
<br>The Palindrome Checker works by reversing the digits of the input number and comparing it with the original number. If the reversed number is equal to the original number, it is considered a palindrome.
